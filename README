Project 1

This code was written in C. It includes implementatin for all 3 phases. Phase 1 is located in v0, phase 2 is in v1, and phase 3 is in v2.

To run the program go to the directory with the files, and write "make" in the command line to build. Then use "./mc0" to run. Typing "make clean" cleans it up.

To run it with test cases use "./mc0 < test.txt". The text file contains the three possible options and when run like this it automatically tests the different functionalities of mc0.

Assumptions

These are some of the assumptions we made:
An unlimited number of commands can be added (because we're using a LinkedList).
However,per command only 79 "words" can be accepted.
