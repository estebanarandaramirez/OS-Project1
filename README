Project 1

This code was written in C. It includes implementatin for all 3 phases. Phase 1 is in mc0, phase 2 is in mc1, and phase 3 is in mc2.

To build all three programs go to the directory with the files, and write "make" or "make all" in the command line. To clean all three files type "make clean". To build the files individually, type "make mc_" (_ being the number of the program that you want to build).

Another method to build the programs is to go into their subdirectories and type "make" or "make all" to build them individually. When inside their subdirectories "make clean" will clean the program in that directory.

To run the programs you have to be inside their specific subdirectories. To run phase 1, type "./mc0". For phase 2, "./mc1", and for phase 3, "./mc2". 

To run it with test cases use the programs name followed by < test.txt, when inisde the proper subdirectory. 
Example: "./mc0 < test.txt"
Doing this will run the program automatically testing it with the inputs from the txt file.

Assumptions

These are some of the assumptions we made:
An unlimited number of commands can be added (because we're using a LinkedList).
However,per command only 79 "words" can be accepted.
