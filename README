Project 1 (Checkpoint)

This code was written in C. As of right now, it includes the features specified for Phase 1.

To run the program go to the directory with the files, and write "make" in the command line to build. Then use "./mc0" to run. 

To run it with test cases use "./mc0 < test.txt". The text file contains the three possible options and when run like this it automatically tests the different functionalities of mc0.
